Comcast does not notify you if the government is requesting data associated with you, likely even if a gag order is not present. They have also received a 1-star privacy rating from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which obviously, is an extremely bad rating. Comcast also fought against Google Chrome &amp; Mozilla Firefox&rsquo;s new encrypted-DNS feature which encrypts DNS traffic that leaves the browser, which makes it harder for Comcast to see what their customers are doing on the internet, but at the same time Comcast also claims that they don&rsquo;t spy on their users. Why would they fight against this privacy-enhancing feature if they don&rsquo;t spy on their users?</p>
<p>Moreover, in the year 2015, a customer of Comcast named Lisa Brown has contacted Comcast&rsquo;s customer service via telephone, requesting for Comcast to downgrade her Comcast service in order to lower her monthly payment. Instead of Comcast doing so immediately, they offered her a service upgrade without extra charge. Lisa, clearly wanting to downgrade her service, refused the offer. Lisa noticed that on the next invoice/monthly bill sent to her, the customer service rep she had contacted had changed her name in the Comcast system from Lisa Brown to “Asshole Brown”. This is a truly horrible company. A similar situation occurred in the year of 2014, where a journalist named Ryan Block called up Comcast to cancel his service. Comcast straight up refused to cancel his service even after 20 minutes of arguing.</p>
<p>Comcast is a company that solely cares about making money, doesn&rsquo;t care one bit about user privacy or service quality, and has god awful and extremely rude customer support. Please avoid this company at all costs.</p>
